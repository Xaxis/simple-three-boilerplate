## Summary

A simple boilerplate for rapidly spinning up single page applications based on Three.js.

This boilerplate is a handy place to get started when developing Three.js based applications where npm, require.js, and
grunt are part of your normal workflow. It includes a prescriptive yet flexible application directory structure tailored
to organizing your source and assets.
